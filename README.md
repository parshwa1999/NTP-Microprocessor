# NTP-microprocessor



* ## Overview
  
  A real time Microprocessor impemented in verilog and tested on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.
  
  It's a RISC based 8 bit 5 stage pilelined processor with 28 bit instruction format and 579.67 Mhz clock frequency.
  
  Individual module implementations for:
  * Instruction Fetch
  * Instruction Decode
  * Execution Block
  * Data Memory Block
  * Write Back Block
  * Dependency Check Block
  * Jump Control Block
  * Stall Control Block
  * Register Bank Block

* ## Specifcations and Features

  * 8-bit Processor.
  * Instruction Size 24-bit.
  * 28 Distinct Instructions.
  * Fixed Instruction Size (24 bits).
  * RISC based architecture.
  * 5 Staged pipelined processor.
  * Maximum Clock Frequency 579.374 MHz.
  * 32 Registers.
  * Ideal CPI = 1.
  * Five types of Instruction format (R, I, J, M and I/O type).
  * Harvard type architecture as there are separate storage blocks and signal pathways are provided for data memory and program memory.
  * Two types of addressing modes register direct mode and register immediate addressing mode.
  * Simpler Architecture.
  * CPI = 1.33333333.
  * Program Memory 768 bytes.
  * Data Memory 256 bytes.
  * 21 pins (data_in 8, data_out 8, clk, reset, Vcc, Ground and Interrupt each)

*Note:- All the modules contain clock (clk) and reset as inputs.*

* ## How to Use
  * After downloading this repository just open NTP-Microprocessor.xise file in Xilinx-ISE.
  * Go to Simulation from the menu shown on top left corner and run Microprocessortb.v file to check simulation results.
  * Or Else upload .bit file on Artix-7 FPGA
  
* In order to write your own assembly code in Assembly_Program.COE in memory_initialization_vector in Hexadecimal format.
* Regenrate Program Memory's IP Core (ROM) and select Assembly_Program.COE while initializing it.
* If Problem still persists you can raise an issue or contact me on [parshwa1999@gmail.com](parshwa1999@gmail.com)
